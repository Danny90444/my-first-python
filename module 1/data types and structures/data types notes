if "banana" in fruits:
  print("yes")

.append() adding an element to a list
.insert(index,element)
.remove remove the first occurance of the element we pass to it
.pop(index) removes an element from the index

enumerate for loop through a list to get the elements of the list as well as the index of those elements
